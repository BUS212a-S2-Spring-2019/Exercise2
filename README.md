The goal of this assignment is to connect you to a repository in GitHub, and to have you complete a few common actions using it. 

Specifically, _after_ you have created a GitHub account and installed the necessary software on your computer, you will:
* "clone" (make a copy of) the course repository to your own computer. The repo includes a short R script. 
* Make some simple modifications to the R code. You will gain practice plotting data with ggplot and reflect upon the results/process of doing so.
* "commit" and "push" your modified R code back to your own repository in our GitHub Classroom.

The idea is to get the GitHub software installed on your computer and verify that things are working properly. When you complete the steps, GitHub will notify me.
